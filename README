A header-only printf format compatible background logging class, modified from a version used for years in production low-latency trading code.
It's currently 40% faster than calling printf directly on my desktop, w/ a larger difference on production boxes (& notably if this is the 
only output used, you're entirely independent of disk-speed in all cases provided the background thread doesn't run out of queue space).

The format & its arguments are placed onto a queue (with zero-terminated strings copied) & only parsed in a background thread. All format
arguments are expected/assumed to be static (or at least live until the background therad reads them).

Format checking on gcc is done at compile time if using the INFO/ZZWARN/FATAL macros.

However, note the background thread currently is implemented using boost::format. One giant downside/bug is that this library does not support the glibc extension %z/%Z (for size_t).
You *must* therefore use %ld instead of %z or you will get a (caught) expection in the logger thread.

Usage:

#include <Logging.h>
...
main() {
  Logging::logOnJunk() = true; // sets the background thread that outputs log messages to the last CPU
...

  std::string s = "testMe";

  INFO("String contains '%s' which is %ld characters long", s.c_str(), s.size());
  // outputs:
  22:28:09.568507 LoggingTest.cpp:83 String contains 'testMe' which is 6 characters long

  ZZWARN("String still contains '%s' which is %ld characters long", s.c_str(), s.size());
  // outputs: (matching on "!!WARNING!!" is useful for monitoring scripts)
  22:28:09.568508 LoggingTest.cpp:84 !!WARNING!! String still contains 'testMe' which is 6 characters long

  FATAL("That's all '%s'", s.c_str());
  // outputs: (and throws an exception, matching on "!!FATAL!!" is useful for monitoring scripts)
  22:28:09.568509 LoggingTest.cpp:86 !!WARNING!! !!FATAL!! That's all 'testMe'

  // to log arbitrary data directly to a FILE* from the background. Note that this has no gcc compile-time format checking currently
  Logging::fprintf(stdout, "This is a test of straight logging on line %ld.\n", __LINE__);
